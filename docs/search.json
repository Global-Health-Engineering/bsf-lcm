It separates the larvae from frass and chicken feed to guarantee high homogeneity of the larvae batch making the sample more representative; and automates counting of samples. The process involves three steps:\n\nSieving\nSedimentation\nCounting\n\n\n\n2 Overview\nThe LCM MK1 consists of two funnels mounted on two flat boards and a 3D printed box containing the electronics. During operation the setup should look as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Larvae Counting Machine Mark 1\n\n\nThe purpose of the first circular funnel is to facilitate the loading of larvae into the second funnel, which in turn forces them to spread out horizontally along the back wall and makes them fall out through holes on the side the funnel one after another. The falling larvae are filmed by a camera located at the back wall of the 3D printed electronics box. Then the LCM MK1 python program, running on a Raspberry Pi 5, uses frame differencing to count the larvae falling through the camera’s field of view.\n\n\n3 Cost breakdown\n\n\n4 Licenses\nThe three core elements of this project are licensed under:\n\n\n\nComponent\nLicense\n\n\n\n\nHardware\nCERN-OHL-S 2.0\n\n\nSoftware\nApache 2.0\n\n\nDocumentation\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Sieves\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Preparation\n\nPlace the collection bowl on the table.\nStack sieves on the bowl starting with the smallest gap on the bottom, progressing up to largest gap. Rotate each sieve 90° relative to sieve below. (Only use 1.5 mm sieve if larvae are small enough to pass through it, otherwise they will get stuck).\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Procedure\n\nPour 100 g of larvae mix into the top sieve.\nRemove the sieves one after another as soon as no more movement is spotted in the sieve (remove them carefully causing as little vibration as possible).\nPour the separated chicken feed from the removed sieves into chicken feed collection container.\n\nRepeat the process if there are still large chunks of chicken feed visible in the larvae mix (2–3 times bigger than the size of the larvae).\nImportant: Only process 100 g of larvae chicken feed mix per batch."

    "text": "1.2 Sedimentation\nThe goal of the sedimentation step is to remove the frass from the previously sieved larvae. Additionally, by using the gold pan, larvae smaller than ~1 mm are also separated. To guarantee a high enough separation quality this step needs to be repeated multiple times.\n\n1.2.1 Materials needed\n\nGold Pan\n\nContainer with sieved larvae (from the previous step)\n\n2 more containers (1 for processed larvae, 1 for frass to be dumped in)\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Procedure\n\nHold the gold pan at an upward angle of around 45° and fill move the preprocessed larvae from the previous step into the gold pan (Processing 100 g of larvae and frass mix was successful; the maximum possible load must be found by trial and error), see Figure 2a.\nTilt the gold pan forward until larvae start pouring out into the collection container. Increase the angle steadily until all large larvae have fallen out of the pan, see Figures 2b and 2c.\nRotate the the gold pan back upwards to a steep angle and knock it on the back so the frass collects at the back side. Then knock from the side to move the frass into a corner. Pour the separated frass into the frass collection container (Smaller larvae may remain in the frass and should be added back into the chicken feed larvae boxes for transfer and counting on a later day).\n\nRepeat this three-step process until the amount of frass removed in each cycle decreases drastically. After finishing, pour the completely preprocessed larvae into another large collection container.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2a. Fill the pan with larvae\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2b. Tilt the pan forward slowly over a container\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2c. Let the larvae with some frass fall into the container\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2d. Tilt the pan backwards and knock the separated frass into a corner"
